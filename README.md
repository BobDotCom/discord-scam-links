# discord-scam-links
One page, easily readable list of phishing Discord-imitating websites

# adding new links
I plan on updating this whenever I come across a new one, feel free to open a pull request if you'd like to suggest any yourself or contacting me via Discord @ Build_Bot#9090

# removing "dead" links
I don't plan on removing links even if they no longer resolve to a valid IP/webpage, as they are and were still created for phishing. However, if by chance any of these domains are acquired by Discord themselves for legitimate purpose, feel free to comment on that & I'll update accordingly!
